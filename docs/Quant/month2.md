Perfect — this is a **very realistic constraint**, and good quants *optimize under constraints*.
So let’s design a **1–2 month “quant crash path”** that:

* Starts from **near-zero finance**
* Avoids fluff
* Builds **real quant intuition**
* Is **doable alongside studies/work**
* Makes you **WorldQuant-aligned**, not “finance YouTube smart”

This is **NOT** “zero → full quant hero”
This **IS** “zero → credible junior quant / researcher mindset”

# 🟡 PHASE 3 (Week 3): Sharpe Ratio + Portfolio Thinking

### 🎯 Goal

Understand **risk-adjusted performance** deeply.

### You will now:

* Learn Sharpe ratio formula (finally)
* Compare strategies properly
* Think in portfolios

### ✅ Checklist

* ⬜ I can compute Sharpe ratio
* ⬜ I know why higher Sharpe > higher return
* ⬜ I understand portfolio vs single bet
* ⬜ I understand diversification mathematically (light)

### 📘 Reading

* *The Four Pillars of Investing* — Bernstein (risk chapters)

### 🎥 Videos

* Ben Felix — Sharpe Ratio
* Yale SOM — Intro to Portfolio Theory

> 💡 This is where “finance intuition” becomes **quant intuition**.

# 🟠 PHASE 4 (Week 4): Reality & Bias (THIS MAKES YOU SERIOUS)

### 🎯 Goal

Not fool yourself.

### Learn:

* Transaction costs
* Overfitting
* Look-ahead bias
* Survivorship bias

### ✅ Checklist

* ⬜ I know why backtests lie
* ⬜ I know why good results disappear
* ⬜ I always ask “after costs?”

### 📘 Reading

* *Fooled by Randomness* — Nassim Taleb (key chapters)

### 🎥 Videos

* Quantopian — Backtesting pitfalls

> 🚨 This mindset alone separates quants from amateurs.

---

# 🔵 PHASE 5 (Weeks 5–6): Quant Coding Essentials

Now only **useful coding**, no ML hype.

### 🎯 Goal

Turn ideas into **testable systems**.

### Learn:

* Python basics
* pandas, numpy
* Simple backtesting
* Performance metrics

### ✅ Checklist

* ⬜ I can load financial time-series data
* ⬜ I can compute returns
* ⬜ I can compute Sharpe
* ⬜ I can compare two strategies

### 📘 Book

* *Python for Data Analysis* — Wes McKinney (core chapters)

### 🎥 Videos

* Corey Schafer — Python
* QuantInsti — Simple backtesting

# 🧠 FINAL 2-MONTH OUTCOME (HONEST)

After 1–2 months, you will be able to:

✅ Explain finance **from first principles**
✅ Think in **risk-adjusted terms**
✅ Understand ETFs, funds, portfolios clearly
✅ Detect **bad strategies** quickly
✅ Build **simple quant research pipelines**
✅ Sound **credible** to quant firms

❌ You won’t be a senior quant
❌ You won’t predict markets
❌ You won’t do deep ML yet

But you will be **dangerous in the right way**.

---

# 🎯 WorldQuant-Aligned Mini Goal (IMPORTANT)

By end of this roadmap, you should be able to answer:

> “Why do we maximize Sharpe, not return?”

If you can answer that **cleanly**,
you are thinking like WorldQuant.

(And yes — WorldQuant is a **quantitative hedge fund** that lives and dies by Sharpe, stability, and robustness.)

WORLDQUANT-ALIGNED QUANT PROJECTS

(1–2 months, beginner → credible quant)

Guiding philosophy used at WorldQuant:
“We don’t predict. We measure small, repeatable advantages.”

🧠 PROJECT 1 — Cost vs Sharpe: Why Fees Kill Alpha
🔍 Research Question

Do lower expense ratio ETFs have higher risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe)?

(This is PERFECTLY aligned with your earlier hypothesis.)

🧩 Why WorldQuant likes this

Uses risk-adjusted thinking

Focuses on guaranteed disadvantage (costs)

No prediction, only measurement

Strong first-principles logic

🛠 What you do (step-by-step)

Collect data:

10–20 ETFs

Expense ratio

Monthly returns (5–10 years)

Compute:

Annual return

Volatility

Sharpe ratio

Group ETFs:

Low cost

Medium cost

High cost

Compare:

Average Sharpe per group

✅ What you must conclude (important)

Not:
❌ “Low cost always wins”

But:
✅ “High costs create a structural drag on Sharpe”

🧠 WorldQuant mindset shown

Controls for risk

Understands friction

Thinks in distributions

📊 PROJECT 2 — Volatility Is the Enemy (Risk > Return)
🔍 Research Question

Can a lower-return but lower-volatility strategy outperform on Sharpe?

🧩 Why this is WorldQuant-aligned

WorldQuant hates unstable returns.
They prefer boring, stable edges.

🛠 What you do

Create two strategies on the same index:

Strategy A: Buy & hold

Strategy B: Volatility-filtered (stay out during high volatility)

Compare:

Return

Volatility

Sharpe

Max drawdown

💡 Key insight you must articulate

“Lower return does NOT mean worse strategy
if risk is controlled.”

This is core quant thinking.

🧠 PROJECT 3 — Diversification as a Mathematical Weapon
🔍 Research Question

Why does combining weak strategies create a strong portfolio?

🧩 Why WorldQuant loves this

Shows portfolio thinking

Uses correlation logic

Demonstrates systems thinking

🛠 What you do

Create 3 simple signals:

Momentum

Mean reversion

Trend filter

Test each:

Individually → low Sharpe

Combine:

Equal-weighted portfolio

Measure:

Portfolio Sharpe

Correlation reduction

🧠 Insight you must explain

“Uncorrelated weakness can become strength.”

This is exactly how quant portfolios are built.

⚠️ PROJECT 4 — Killing a Strategy (Bias Detection Project)

🔥 This project makes you look mature.

🔍 Research Question

How do backtests lie to us?

🧩 Why this is gold

WorldQuant rejects people who:

Trust backtests blindly

Don’t detect bias

🛠 What you do

Build a strategy that looks amazing

Then:

Add transaction costs

Remove look-ahead bias

Fix survivorship bias

Watch performance collapse

🧠 The correct conclusion

“The strategy never worked — I fooled myself.”

This honesty is quant credibility.
