Based on my thorough review of all 3 pages on the LockedIn AI website for Barclays interviews, here are **ALL** the questions asked for Software Engineering roles (including all levels - intern, graduate, senior, and VP):

## **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)**

### String/Array Problems
1. Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
2. Find the first non-repeating character in a string in O(n) time
3. Filter odd numbers from a list using Java Streams
4. Write a function to count the occurrences of each character in a given string
5. Write a function to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string
6. Write a function to reverse a linked list
7. Compute the sum of digits of a number and extend it to repeatedly sum digits until a single-digit result (digital root)

### Java/Collections Specific
8. Explain the internal working of HashMap in Java, including how collisions are handled and time complexity
9. Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java and when to use each
10. Describe how Java's HashMap works internally (buckets, hash function, collisions, time complexity)
11. Explain the relationship between hashCode() and equals() and impact of poor hashCode implementations
12. Can you explain what a Singleton class is and why it is used?

### Data Cleaning/Processing
13. Write a Python script to perform data cleaning on a given dataset, handling missing values and outliers
14. Write a function to calculate the moving average of a list of numbers with a window size of 3
