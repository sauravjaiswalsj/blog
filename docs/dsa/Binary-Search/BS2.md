# Binary Search on Answer

## What?

We apply the same binary search logic in this case as well. However, the caveat is that the we need to develop a criterion to check if the mid element is the answer or not.

We need to develop a criterion to check if the mid element is the answer or not. If it is, we return the mid element. If not, we move to the left or right half of the array depending on the criterion.

Binary search on answer is applied when we need to find the minimum or maximum value of a function that is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

BS can still be applied on the unsorted array, using this technique.
