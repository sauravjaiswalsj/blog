**“Funds with lower expense ratios have higher risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)”**

Before jumping to videos/articles, let’s **frame the learning problem properly** (first-principles style 👇).

---

## Step 1: What problem are we trying to understand?

> Why do some mutual funds / ETFs *feel* better investments even when raw returns look similar?

Two funds may:

* Give similar annual returns
* Take similar risks
  Yet one is considered **better**

👉 So what’s missing from just “returns”?

---

## Step 2: What is the hidden problem with looking only at returns?

**Returns alone lie.**

Ask yourself:

* Did the fund take **huge risk** to get those returns?
* Did the investor keep **less money** after fees?
* Was the journey **stable or volatile**?

So the real problems are:

1. **Risk is ignored**
2. **Costs are ignored**

---

## Step 3: How do we measure “return per unit of pain”?

This leads to a natural question:

> “How much return am I getting **for the risk I’m taking**?”

That question **creates the need** for the **Sharpe Ratio**.

**Sharpe Ratio = (Return − Risk-free rate) / Volatility**

👉 Higher Sharpe = **better risk-adjusted performance**

---

## Step 4: Where do expense ratios enter the picture?

Now ask a very human question:

> “If two funds invest in the same market, why would one have a lower Sharpe ratio?”

Think slowly 👇

* Fees are **guaranteed losses**
* Market returns are **uncertain**
* Risk (volatility) **does not decrease** because of fees

So:

* Returns go **down**
* Risk stays the **same**

📉 Sharpe ratio falls.

---

## Step 5: Root cause (this is the key insight)

**Expense ratios reduce returns without reducing risk.**

That is the **root cause**.

> Lower return + same volatility = worse Sharpe ratio

So **naturally**:

✅ Funds with **lower expense ratios** tend to show
👉 **higher risk-adjusted returns**

Not because they are smarter —
but because they **leak less money**.

## Step 6: Now you’re ready to learn from experts (videos & articles)

Below are **high-quality beginner-friendly resources** that explain this exact idea clearly.

## Step 7: How you should study this (important)

Use this **thinking sequence while watching/reading**:

1. What problem is the investor facing?
2. Why do returns alone fail?
3. Why does volatility matter?
4. Where do costs enter the equation?
5. Why do fees hurt Sharpe ratio *more than returns*?
6. What kind of funds naturally win because of this?

If you want, next we can:

* **Test this hypothesis with real data (Python / Excel)**
* **Design a proper finance project**
* **Frame this as a CS910 / data-analysis hypothesis**
* **Compare active vs passive funds empirically**

and I’ll keep **this exact first-principles style** throughout 🚀
