# Finance 101
## 🌱 Let’s start from absolute ZERO

## Step 0: Imagine a very simple story (no finance yet)

You have **₹100**.

You give it to **Person A** and say:

> “Please invest this money for me and give me profit after 1 year.”

Person A says:

* “I’ll invest it”
* “But I’ll take **₹2** as my service fee”

👉 That **₹2** is the **expense ratio** (but don’t memorize this yet).

---

## Step 1: What is the REAL problem we are trying to solve?

Let’s ask a **very natural question**:

> “How do I know if Person A is doing a GOOD job?”

Possible wrong answer:
❌ “If I get profit”

Why is this wrong?

Because:

* Anyone can get profit by **taking big risks**
* Or by **luck**

So the real question becomes:

> “How much profit did I get **compared to how risky the investment was**?”

This question **creates the need** for Sharpe ratio.

---

## Step 2: What is “risk” in human terms?

Forget formulas.

### Risk = **How scary the journey is**

Imagine two roads:

### Road A:

* Smooth
* Small ups and downs

### Road B:

* Huge ups
* Huge crashes
* Heart attacks every month

Even if **both end at the same destination**, which road is better?

👉 Road A.

So:

* Risk = **how wildly the value moves**
* In finance, we call this **volatility**

---

## Step 3: The hidden mistake beginners make

Most beginners think:

> “More return = better investment”

But that ignores:

* Stress
* Crashes
* Panic selling

So we ask a smarter question:

> “How much return did I get **for each unit of risk** I took?”

💡 This question **forces the Sharpe ratio into existence**

---

## Step 4: Sharpe Ratio (explained like a human)

### Very simple meaning:

> **Sharpe Ratio = reward for pain**

Think of it like:

* Gym gains per workout pain
* Salary per hour worked
* Marks per hour studied

Higher = better.

So:

* **High Sharpe** → good returns, calm journey
* **Low Sharpe** → returns came with chaos

⚠️ Do NOT worry about the formula yet.

---

## Step 5: Now another natural question arises…

> “If two funds invest in the SAME market, why would one have lower Sharpe?”

Let’s think slowly.

### What things reduce your final money?

* Bad decisions ❌
* Market crash ❌
* **Fees** ✅ (always guaranteed)

Fees are **certain losses**.

---

## Step 6: Expense Ratio (explained from zero)

### Simple definition:

> **Expense ratio = yearly fee taken by the fund manager**

Example:

* You invest ₹100
* Expense ratio = 2%
* Manager takes ₹2 **every year**

Even if:

* Market is bad ❌
* Market is good ❌

The fee is taken **no matter what**.

---

## Step 7: Root cause (THIS is the heart of everything)

Ask this carefully:

> “Do fees reduce risk?”

❌ No.

> “Do fees reduce returns?”

✅ Yes. Always.

So what happens?

* Return ↓
* Risk stays same

💥 That **automatically destroys Sharpe ratio**

---

## Step 8: The big truth (arrived naturally)

Now the hypothesis makes sense:

> **Funds with lower expense ratios tend to have higher Sharpe ratios**

Not because they are smarter
Not because they predict markets

But because:

> **They leak less money every year**

This is pure math. No opinion.

---

## Step 9: One powerful analogy (remember this forever)

### Expense ratio = hole in a bucket

* Market fills the bucket with water (returns)
* Hole drains water (fees)
* Risk = how violently water sloshes

Bigger hole → less water at the end
Same sloshing → worse Sharpe

# Risk and Sharpe Ratio

## Step 1: Let’s forget investing completely

Imagine **two jobs**.

### Job A

* Salary: ₹50,000 per month
* Paid **on time**
* Same amount every month
* Calm life 😌

### Job B

* “Average” salary: ₹50,000 per month
* Some months: ₹1,00,000
* Some months: ₹10,000
* Some months: ₹0
* Constant stress 😰

Now answer honestly (no “smart” answer):

> If both *average* to ₹50,000…
> **Which job would you prefer?**

Most humans choose **Job A**.

---

## Step 2: Why do we prefer Job A?

Let’s ask the *why* (this is first-principles thinking):

* Is it because Job A pays more? ❌ (same average)
* Is it because Job B is illegal? ❌
* Is it because Job A is **predictable**? ✅

So the real difference is:

> **How much the income jumps around**

That “jumping around” feeling is the core of **risk**.

---

## Step 3: So what is “risk” really?

In human words:

> **Risk = how unstable or unpredictable the outcome is**

NOT:

* Danger
* Loss
* Bad decision

Just:

* **Ups and downs**

More ups & downs → more risk
Fewer ups & downs → less risk

---

## Step 4: Now bring money into the picture (business)

Imagine **two shop owners**.

### Shop A

* Earns ₹5,000 profit every day
* Some days ₹4,800, some days ₹5,200

### Shop B

* Some days ₹20,000 profit
* Some days ₹-10,000 loss
* Average still ₹5,000/day

Again, ask naturally:

> Same average profit — which business sleeps better at night?

👉 Shop A.

Why?

Because:

* Rent
* Salaries
* Bills

Life needs **stability**, not averages.

---

## Step 5: The first BIG insight (pause here)

So we’ve discovered something important:

> **Average outcome is not enough to judge quality**

We ALSO care about:

* Stability
* Predictability
* Smoothness of journey

This is the **exact reason finance invented “risk-adjusted” measures**.

---

## Step 6: Now a question MUST arise

Think carefully:

> “If two things give the same result,
> but one is calmer…
> shouldn’t the calmer one be called *better*?”

YES.

That question **creates Sharpe ratio**.

---

## Step 7: Sharpe Ratio (ONLY meaning, no math)

In plain English:

> **Sharpe ratio asks:**
> “How much reward did I get for how wild the journey was?”

High Sharpe:

* Good reward
* Calm ride

Low Sharpe:

* Same reward
* Roller-coaster ride 🎢

---

## Step 8: DO NOT memorize yet

If you remember only ONE sentence, remember this:

> **Sharpe ratio = calm reward vs chaotic reward**

That’s enough for now.

---

## Step 9: What’s next (very important)

Now that **risk makes sense**, the NEXT natural question is:

> “What things reduce reward WITHOUT reducing risk?”

Because that would:

* Make the journey equally wild
* But pay us less

💡 This question leads directly to **expense ratio**.

---


# Expense Ratio: how it affects risk-adjusted returns

# Step 2: A problem we haven’t noticed yet

We already learned:

> Same average result ≠ same quality
> Stability matters.

Now a **new natural question** appears:

> “What things quietly reduce my final reward even if I take the SAME risk?”

Let’s answer this **without finance words**.

---

## Step 3: A very real business story

Imagine **you own a small shop**.

* You invested ₹1,00,000
* The shop makes profit from customers
* You don’t manage it yourself

So you hire a **manager**.

### Manager says:

> “I’ll run the shop for you,
> but I’ll take **₹2 out of every ₹100** the shop is worth, every year.”

Important:

* Even if profit is low → he takes money
* Even if profit is high → he takes money
* Even if shop struggles → he still takes money

Pause here and think.

---

## Step 4: Ask the key human questions

Let’s think slowly:

### Q1: Does the manager reduce business risk?

* Does he make customers more predictable?
* Does he reduce good/bad days?

❌ No.

### Q2: Does the manager reduce your final money?

✅ Yes. Always.

So we have something interesting:

> **Money goes down, but risk stays the same**

⚠️ This is the heart of the problem.

---

## Step 5: Now the word appears (only now)

That manager’s yearly cut is called:

> **Expense Ratio**

In investing:

* You give money to a fund
* Fund manager runs it
* He takes a small % every year

That % = expense ratio

---

## Step 6: Why expense ratio is dangerous (deep insight)

Let’s connect dots:

* Market gives ups & downs (risk)
* Manager takes money **no matter what**
* So:

  * Ups get smaller
  * Downs stay equally painful

Result?

> Same roller-coaster 🎢
> Smaller reward at the end

---

## Step 7: Now Sharpe ratio returns (naturally)

Remember:

> Sharpe ratio = reward compared to risk

Now think:

* Reward ↓
* Risk → same

So what happens?

👉 **Sharpe ratio goes DOWN**

No formula needed. This is pure logic.

---

## Step 8: BIG “aha” moment

This is the truth behind your hypothesis:

> **Lower expense ratio funds often have higher Sharpe ratios**

Not because:

* They predict better ❌
* They are smarter ❌

But because:

> **They leak less money while taking the same risk**

---

## Step 9: Lock this in with one analogy

### Expense ratio = rent on a shop

* You pay rent whether customers come or not
* Rent doesn’t reduce chaos
* It only reduces profit

Lower rent = better business
Lower expense ratio = better investment
